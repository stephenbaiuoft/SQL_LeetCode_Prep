### Median Employee Salary

	The Employee table holds all employees. The employee table has three columns: Employee Id, Company Name, and Salary.
	
	+-----+------------+--------+
	|Id   | Company    | Salary |
	+-----+------------+--------+
	|1    | A          | 2341   |
	|2    | A          | 341    |
	|3    | A          | 15     |
	|4    | A          | 15314  |
	|5    | A          | 451    |
	|6    | A          | 513    |
	|7    | B          | 15     |
	|8    | B          | 13     |
	|9    | B          | 1154   |
	|10   | B          | 1345   |
	|11   | B          | 1221   |
	|12   | B          | 234    |
	|13   | C          | 2345   |
	|14   | C          | 2645   |
	|15   | C          | 2645   |
	|16   | C          | 2652   |
	|17   | C          | 65     |
	+-----+------------+--------+
	Write a SQL query to find the median salary of each company. Bonus points if you can solve it without using any built-in SQL functions.
	
	+-----+------------+--------+
	|Id   | Company    | Salary |
	+-----+------------+--------+
	|5    | A          | 451    |
	|6    | A          | 513    |
	|12   | B          | 234    |
	|9    | B          | 1154   |
	|14   | C          | 2645   |
	+-----+------------+--------+
	

### **Idea**
* **USE** `SELF JOIN` to help comparing each Id with its Id in companies
* **USE** `CASE WHEN condition 1 THEN val_1` + `SUM(CASE(expression_1))` + `abs(expression_1)` based on the median definition
	* **Note** the `SUM` + `GROUP BY`** Means Using** `HAVING condition_1`
	


### Solution 1
	SELECT e1.Id, e1.Company, e1.Salary
	  FROM Employee e1 
	  JOIN Employee e2
	  ON e1.Company = e2.Company
	  GROUP BY e1.Id    
	  HAVING 1 >= ABS (SUM(CASE WHEN e2.Salary < e1.Salary THEN -1
	                           WHEN e2.Salary > e1.Salary THEN 1
	                           WHEN e2.Salary = e1.Salary AND e2.Id < e1.Id THEN -1
	                           WHEN e2.Salary = e1.Salary AND e2.Id > e1.Id THEN 1
	                           ELSE 0 END
	                 ))  
	  ORDER BY e1.Company, e1.Salary
