Available @ <https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-distance-in-a-plane/description/>
### Shortest Distance in a Plane 

	Table point_2d holds the coordinates (x,y) of some unique points (more than two) in a plane.
	Write a query to find the shortest distance between these points rounded to 2 decimals.
	| x  | y  |
	|----|----|
	| -1 | -1 |
	| 0  | 0  |
	| -1 | -2 |
	The shortest distance is 1.00 from point (-1,-1) to (-1,2). So the output should be:
	| shortest |
	|----------|
	| 1.00     |
	Note: The longest distance among all the points are less than 10000.

### **Idea**
* **USE** `Composite Scalar Functions` such as `POWER( val_1, num_1)` + `SQRT(val_1)`
	* **Note** composite scalar functions are allowed in SAME SELECT Scope

* **USE** `MIN` aggregate function to extract the result	

### Solution 1
	SELECT MIN(ROUND( SQRT( POWER(q1.x - q2.x, 2) + POWER(q1.y - q2.y, 2)), 2)  ) AS shortest
	  FROM point_2d q1
	  LEFT JOIN point_2d q2
	  ON (q1.x != q2.x OR q1.y != q2.y)
