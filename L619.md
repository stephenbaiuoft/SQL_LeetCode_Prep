## Question L619

###  Biggest Single Number
Available @ <https://leetcode.com/problems/biggest-single-number/description/>

	Table number contains many numbers in column num including duplicated ones.
	Can you write a SQL query to find the biggest number, which only appears once.
	+---+
	|num|
	+---+
	| 8 |
	| 8 |
	| 3 |
	| 3 |
	| 1 |
	| 4 |
	| 5 |
	| 6 | 
	For the sample data above, your query should return the following result:
	+---+
	|num|
	+---+
	| 6 |
	Note:
	If there is no such number, just output null.


### **Idea**	
* composite `Aggregate functions` 
	* Note the logics **MUST** require `>=2 SELECT` to handle `>=2 aggregate functions`


### Solution
	SELECT MAX(v1.num) AS num
	FROM 
	(SELECT num
	  FROM number
	  GROUP BY num
	  HAVING COUNT(num) = 1) v1
