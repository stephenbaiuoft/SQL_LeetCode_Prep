### Find Median Given Frequency of Numbers

	The Numbers table keeps the value of number and its frequency.
	
	+----------+-------------+
	|  Number  |  Frequency  |
	+----------+-------------|
	|  0       |  7          |
	|  1       |  1          |
	|  2       |  3          |
	|  3       |  1          |
	+----------+-------------+
	In this table, the numbers are 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, so the median is (0 + 0) / 2 = 0.
	
	+--------+
	| median |
	+--------|
	| 0.0000 |
	+--------+
	Write a query to find the median of all numbers and name the result as median.

	

### **Idea**

* **USE** `median property` + `subquery` + `abs(expression_1)`
* **KEY**
	

##### Example 
* **Note** ***value 5 & 100*** are the median values, and note their SUM(frequency) <br> from left and right

	Values | 1 	| 5 	| 100 | 366
	--- 	| ---  | --- | ---  | ---
**Count**  | 4	| 	1	| 	1	| 4	  |
	**SUM**	    | (4,12) | (5,6) |(5,6) |(12,4) |
	

### Solution 1
	SELECT AVG(n.Number) AS median
	  FROM Numbers n
	  WHERE n.Frequency >= abs (
	  	(SELECT SUM(Frequency) FROM Numbers n1 WHERE n.Number >= n1.Number)
		- 
	  	(SELECT SUM(Frequency) FROM Numbers n1 WHERE n.Number <= n1.Number	  	
	  )
