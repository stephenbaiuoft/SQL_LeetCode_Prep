### Count Student Number in Departments 

	A university uses 2 data tables, student and department, to store data about its students and the departments associated with each major.
	
	Write a query to print the respective department name and number of students majoring in each department for all departments in the department table (even ones with no current students).
	
	Sort your results by descending number of students; if two or more departments have the same number of students, then sort those departments alphabetically by department name.
	
	The student is described as follow:
	
	| Column Name  | Type      |
	|--------------|-----------|
	| student_id   | Integer   |
	| student_name | String    |
	| gender       | Character |
	| dept_id      | Integer   |
	where student_id is the student's ID number, student_name is the student's name, gender is their gender, and dept_id is the department ID associated with their declared major.
	
	And the department table is described as below:
	
	| Column Name | Type    |
	|-------------|---------|
	| dept_id     | Integer |
	| dept_name   | String  |
	where dept_id is the department's ID number and dept_name is the department name.
	
	Here is an example input:
	student table:
	
	| student_id | student_name | gender | dept_id |
	|------------|--------------|--------|---------|
	| 1          | Jack         | M      | 1       |
	| 2          | Jane         | F      | 1       |
	| 3          | Mark         | M      | 2       |
	department table:
	
	| dept_id | dept_name   |
	|---------|-------------|
	| 1       | Engineering |
	| 2       | Science     |
	| 3       | Law         |
	The Output should be:
	
	| dept_name   | student_number |
	|-------------|----------------|
	| Engineering | 2              |
	| Science     | 1              |
	| Law         | 0              |

### **Idea**
* **USE** `LEFT JOIN` + `COUNT(col_val)` **INSTEAD OF** `COUNT(1)`
	* **Note** COUNT(col_val) = 0 if that row is NULL
	* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; COUNT(1) = 1 if that regarldess whether row IS NULL

* **USE** `MIN` aggregate function to extract the result	

### Solution 1 (LEFT JOIN) AND (RIGHT JOIN)
	SELECT d1.dept_name, COUNT(s1.student_id) AS student_number
	  FROM department d1
	  LEFT JOIN student s1
	  ON d1.dept_id = s1.dept_id
	  GROUP BY d1.dept_id, d1.dept_name
	  ORDER BY COUNT(s1.student_id) DESC, d1.dept_name  
	
	-- **HERE IS RIGHT JOIN** --   
	SELECT d1.dept_name, COUNT(s1.student_id) AS student_number
	  FROM student s1
	  RIGHT JOIN department d1
	  ON d1.dept_id = s1.dept_id
	  GROUP BY d1.dept_id, d1.dept_name
	  ORDER BY COUNT(s1.student_id) DESC, d1.dept_name
