### Managers with at Least 5 Direct Reports
	The Employee table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.
	
	+------+----------+-----------+----------+
	|Id    |Name 	  |Department |ManagerId |
	+------+----------+-----------+----------+
	|101   |John 	  |A 	      |null      |
	|102   |Dan 	  |A 	      |101       |
	|103   |James 	  |A 	      |101       |
	|104   |Amy 	  |A 	      |101       |
	|105   |Anne 	  |A 	      |101       |
	|106   |Ron 	  |B 	      |101       |
	+------+----------+-----------+----------+
	Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out managers with at least 5 direct report. For the above table, your SQL query should return:
	
	+-------+
	| Name  |
	+-------+
	| John  |
	+-------+
	Note:
	No one would report to himself.

### **Idea**

* **USE** Apply `SELECT FROM` but, each time filtering down rows 

### Solution 3 (Fastest)
	SELECT Name
	FROM Employee
	WHERE Id IN 
	    (SELECT ManagerId
	      FROM Employee
	      GROUP BY ManagerId
	      HAVING COUNT(1) >=5)

### **Idea**

* **USE** JOIN to filter out results

### Solution 2
	SELECT e1.Name
	  FROM Employee e1
	  JOIN Employee e2
	  ON e1.Id = e2.ManagerId
	  GROUP BY e1.Id
	  HAVING COUNT(e2.ManagerId) >= 5
		

### **Idea**

* **USE** Subqueries to provide these two requirements. 
	* **IS** a manager 
	* **has** over 5 reports
 
### Solution 1
	SELECT e1.Name
	  FROM Employee e1
	  WHERE e1.Id IN (SELECT DISTINCT ManagerId FROM Employee)
	        AND 
	        5 <= (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e2.Id)
	              FROM Employee e2
	              WHERE e2.ManagerId = e1.Id
	             )
	
	      
	WHERE Candidate.id = v2.CandidateId
