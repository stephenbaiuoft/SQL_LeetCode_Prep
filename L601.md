### Human Traffic of Stadium
Available @ <https://leetcode.com/problems/human-traffic-of-stadium/description/>

	X city built a new stadium, each day many people visit it and the stats are saved as these columns: id, date, people
	
	Please write a query to display the records which have 3 or more consecutive rows and the amount of people more than 100(inclusive).
	
	For example, the table stadium:
	+------+------------+-----------+
	| id   | date       | people    |
	+------+------------+-----------+
	| 1    | 2017-01-01 | 10        |
	| 2    | 2017-01-02 | 109       |
	| 3    | 2017-01-03 | 150       |
	| 4    | 2017-01-04 | 99        |
	| 5    | 2017-01-05 | 145       |
	| 6    | 2017-01-06 | 1455      |
	| 7    | 2017-01-07 | 199       |
	| 8    | 2017-01-08 | 188       |
	+------+------------+-----------+
	For the sample data above, the output is:
	
	+------+------------+-----------+
	| id   | date       | people    |
	+------+------------+-----------+
	| 5    | 2017-01-05 | 145       |
	| 6    | 2017-01-06 | 1455      |
	| 7    | 2017-01-07 | 199       |
	| 8    | 2017-01-08 | 188       |
	+------+------------+-----------+
	Note:
	Each day only have one row record, and the dates are increasing with id increasing.


### **Idea**

* **USE** `sql range!!` **by using** `LEFT JOIN` 
	* IF(express1, true_val, false_val)
	* **COUNT**(IF(if_statement_expr)) >= 3 is also important!
	* **JOIN** OR LEFT JOIN to ***set up*** the range 
		* 	`s2.id <= s1.id` **AND** `s2.id >= s1.id - 2`

### Solution 1
	SELECT DISTINCT s.id, s.date, s.people
	FROM stadium s
	JOIN
	(SELECT s1.id
	  FROM stadium s1
	  JOIN stadium s2
	  WHERE s2.id <= s1.id AND s2.id >= s1.id - 2 
	  GROUP BY s1.id
	  HAVING COUNT( IF(s2.people >= 100, 1, NULL)) >= 3
	) upper_limit  
	WHERE s.id <= upper_limit.id  AND s.id >= upper_limit.id - 2

	

### **Idea**

* **USE** `UNION` to get the remaining id! and select those

### Solution 1
	SELECT s.id, s.date, s.people
	FROM stadium s
	JOIN
	(SELECT s1.id
	  FROM stadium s1
	  JOIN stadium s2
	  JOIN stadium s3
	  WHERE s1.id = s2.id - 1 AND s2.id = s3.id -1 
	        AND s1.people >= 100 AND s2.people >= 100 AND s3.people >=100
	        
	UNION
	SELECT s2.id
	  FROM stadium s1
	  JOIN stadium s2
	  JOIN stadium s3
	  WHERE s1.id = s2.id - 1 AND s2.id = s3.id -1 
	        AND s1.people >= 100 AND s2.people >= 100 AND s3.people >=100
	UNION        
	SELECT s3.id
	  FROM stadium s1
	  JOIN stadium s2
	  JOIN stadium s3
	  WHERE s1.id = s2.id - 1 AND s2.id = s3.id -1 
	        AND s1.people >= 100 AND s2.people >= 100 AND s3.people >=100 ) v
	WHERE s.id = v.id
