### Winning Candidate

	Table: Candidate
	
	+-----+---------+
	| id  | Name    |
	+-----+---------+
	| 1   | A       |
	| 2   | B       |
	| 3   | C       |
	| 4   | D       |
	| 5   | E       |
	+-----+---------+  
	Table: Vote
	
	+-----+--------------+
	| id  | CandidateId  |
	+-----+--------------+
	| 1   |     2        |
	| 2   |     4        |
	| 3   |     3        |
	| 4   |     2        |
	| 5   |     5        |
	+-----+--------------+
	id is the auto-increment primary key,
	CandidateId is the id appeared in Candidate table.
	Write a sql to find the name of the winning candidate, the above example will return the winner B.
	
	+------+
	| Name |
	+------+
	| B    |
	+------+
	Notes:
	You may assume there is no tie, in other words there will be at most one winning candidate.

	

### **Idea**

* **USE** `COUNT() + MAX()` and `nested queries` in order to execute these aggregate functions

### Solution 1
	SELECT Name 
	FROM Candidate 
	JOIN 
	(SELECT CandidateId, MAX(id_count)
	FROM 
	    (SELECT CandidateId, COUNT(id) as id_count
	      FROM Vote
	      GROUP BY CandidateId
	      ORDER BY COUNT(id) DESC
	    ) v_count 
	)  v2
	
	      
	WHERE Candidate.id = v2.CandidateId   

### **Idea**

* **USE** subquery to retrieve result

### Solution 2
	select C.name from Candidate C
	where C.id =
	(select V1.CandidateId from
	(select CandidateId, Count(Id) as Counts from Vote
	group by CandidateId) V1
	order by V1.Counts desc
	limit 1)
