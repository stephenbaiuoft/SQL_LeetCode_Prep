### Consecutive Available Seats
Available @ <https://leetcode.com/problems/consecutive-available-seats/description/>

	Several friends at a cinema ticket office would like to reserve consecutive available seats.
	Can you help to query all the consecutive available seats order by the seat_id using the following cinema table?
	| seat_id | free |
	|---------|------|
	| 1       | 1    |
	| 2       | 0    |
	| 3       | 1    |
	| 4       | 1    |
	| 5       | 1    |
	Your query should return the following result for the sample case above.
	| seat_id |
	|---------|
	| 3       |
	| 4       |
	| 5       |
	Note:
	The seat_id is an auto increment int, and free is bool ('1' means free, and '0' means occupied.).
	Consecutive available seats are more than 2(inclusive) seats consecutively available.
	
	### **Idea**
	
	* **USE** `sql range!!` **by using** `SELF JOIN` 
		* A.Id, A.Month, B.Id, B.Month, B.Salary
			* A.Id = B.Id
			* Then this means if given the table 
	
		| Id | Month | Salary |
		|----|-------|--------|
		| 1  | 3     | 40     |
		| 1  | 2     | 30     |
		| 1  | 1     | 20     |
		
	*	**After self-join**!!!
		
		| A.Id | A.Month | A.Salary |	B.Id | B.Month | B.Salary |
		|------|-------- | -------- |	---- | ------- | -------  |
		| 1    | 3       | 40       | 1    | 1       | 20      
		| 1    | 3       | 40       | 1    | 2       | 30

### Idea
* `UNION` TO JOIN 2 sets
* `SELF-JOIN` + `WHERE condition_1` to **ALWAYS** **SELECT** the **FIRST** **Consecutive** Row	
* `SELF-JOIN` + `WHERE condition_2` to **ALWAYS** **SELECT** the **LAST** **Consecutive** Row	
* 	
### Solution 1
	SELECT v1.seat_id
	FROM
	(SELECT c1.seat_id
	  FROM cinema c1
	  JOIN cinema c2
	  WHERE c1.seat_id = c2.seat_id - 1 AND
	  		 c1.free = 1 AND c2.free = 1
	UNION
	SELECT c1.seat_id
	  FROM cinema c1
	  JOIN cinema c2
	  WHERE c1.seat_id = c2.seat_id + 1 AND
	        c1.free = 1 AND c2.free = 1 ) v1
 	ORDER BY v1.seat_id
